# NumericalMethodsAlgorithms

This repository contains several folders, each containing one function and one README.md file describing the purpose of that function

### False Position
#### Created: 19 Feb 2018
The function uses the false position method to estimate the root of a given function

### LU Factor
#### Created: 26 Mar 2018
The function breaks a given matrix into its lower triangular and upper triangular matrices

### Inverse Matrix
#### Created  26 March 2018
This function uses the previously mentioned LU Factor algorithm to compute the inverse of an inputed matrix

### Simpson
#### Created: 9 Apr 2018
The function utilizes Simpson's 1/3 rule to approximate the integral of a given function. If necessary based on the input the function will utilize the trapezoidal rule to complete the estimate

### Heun
#### Created: 29 April 2018
The function uses Heun's method (or the Improved Euler's method) to come up with a numerical solution to an inputed differential equation
